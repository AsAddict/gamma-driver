# gamma-driver

Gamma-Driver is a library for writing WebGL state & resource managment algorithms. It simplifies creating, installing, and binding WebGL resources such as shader programs and data, and allows expression of higher-order state & resource management algorithms. 

Gamma-Driver is suitable both for beginners looking to get up and running quickly, and by experts needing to implement specialized needs and optimizations. 

Benefits:
 - reduce boilerplate, incidental complexity 
 - decouple graphics pipeline from state & resource managment strategies

# gamma-driver

Gamma-Driver simplifies manipulating stateful WebGL resources. It models the WebGL API in a direct and simple way with a combination of interfaces (protocols in Clojure) and data-oriented resource descriptions. This allows for improved composition, reasoning, and optimization over the traditional imperative WebGL API.  

Gamma-Driver is very WIP, APIs are still in flux.

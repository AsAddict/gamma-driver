Gamma-Driver simplifies manipulating stateful WebGL resources. It models the WebGL API in a direct and simple way with a combination of interfaces (protocols in Clojure) and data-oriented resource descriptions. This allows for improved composition, reasoning, and optimization compared to the traditional imperative WebGL API and to existing WebGL frameworks. 

Gamma-Driver is very WIP, APIs are still in flux.
